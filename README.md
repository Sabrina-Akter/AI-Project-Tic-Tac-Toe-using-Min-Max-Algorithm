# Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI
- This project implements an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game using the Minimax algorithm. <br>
- The AI player is designed to look ahead a few steps and choose the best possible move to make.

## Gameplay
The AI cannot be defeated. Every game either ends in a draw or the AI winning.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Minimax Algorithm

## Installation
1.	At first, you need to have Python and Pygame installed.
2.	Clone the repository to your local machine.
3.	Run the runner.py file. You have working Tic-Tac-Toe.

## How to Play
1.	The game will display a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board.
2.	The player can choose to play as 'X' or 'O'.
3.	If the player chooses 'X', he goes first. If the player chooses 'O', the AI goes first.
4.	The player and the AI take turns marking cells on the board until either the player or the AI wins, or the game ends in a draw.
5.	To win, the player must get three of his symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before the AI does.
6.	If the game ends in a draw, neither the player nor the AI wins.
